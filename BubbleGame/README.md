## This project is inspired from Sheriyan Coding school.. IN Few days I will be trying to build something that adds more layers to it
and also learning a bit of how to write README files [visit](https://youtube.com) 

``` Python
print("This doesn't do anything")
foo = int(123.234)
poo = lambda x : x / 123
print(poo(foo))
```

## End this
[2025]
